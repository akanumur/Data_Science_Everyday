# Data Science Everyday

*"Practice makes perfect. After long time of practicing, our work becomes natural, skillful, swift and steady. -Bruce Lee"*

I am someone who believes by practicing anything you want to achieve you will be more confident and contented with what you learn. This journey has started because of passion for datascience. I want to learn something new everyday. This could anything from the courses I do or Coding challenges I take or if I come across anything interesting topic in Data Science.
