    "# EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the previous image processing I'm trying to perform EAST Text Detection which performs well on extracting the text from scene location.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Natural scene text detection is different though — and much more challenging.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the challenges in detecting scene text are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Image/sensor noise__: Sensor noise from a handheld camera is typically higher than that of a traditional scanner. Additionally, low-priced cameras will typically interpolate the pixels of raw sensors to produce real colors.\n",
    "- __Viewing angles__: Natural scene text can naturally have viewing angles that are not parallel to the text, making the text harder to recognize.\n",
    "- __Blurring__: Uncontrolled environments tend to have blur, especially if the end user is utilizing a smartphone that does not have some form of stabilization.\n",
    "- __Lighting conditions__: We cannot make any assumptions regarding our lighting conditions in natural scene images. It may be near dark, the flash on the camera may be on, or the sun may be shining brightly, saturating the entire image.\n",
    "- __Resolution__: Not all cameras are created equal — we may be dealing with cameras with sub-par resolution.\n",
    "- __Non-paper objects__: Most, but not all, paper is not reflective (at least in context of paper you are trying to scan). Text in natural scenes may be reflective, including logos, signs, etc.\n",
    "- __Non-planar objects__: Consider what happens when you wrap text around a bottle — the text on the surface becomes distorted and deformed. While humans may still be able to easily “detect” and read the text, our algorithms will struggle. We need to be able to handle such use cases.\n",
    "- __Unknown layout__: We cannot use any a priori information to give our algorithms “clues” as to where the text resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EAST pipeline is capable of predicting words and lines of text at arbitrary orientations on 720p images, and furthermore, can run at 13 FPS, according to the authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps most importantly, since the deep learning model is end-to-end, it is possible to sidestep computationally expensive sub-algorithms that other text detectors typically apply, including candidate aggregation and word partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build and train such a deep learning model, the EAST method utilizes novel, carefully designed loss functions.\n"
