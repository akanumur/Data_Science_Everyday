Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM table_name -- table_name changes for each table we are testing
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
--Solution 
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT( id))
FROM Business;
--
ii. Hours = 1562
--Solution
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT(business_id))
FROM hours;
--
iii. Category = 2643
--Solution
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT(business_id))
FROM category;
iv. Attribute = 1115
--Solution
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT(business_id))
FROM attribute;
v. Review = id = 10000; business_id = 8090; user_id = 9581
--Solution
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT(key))
FROM review;
--

vi. Checkin = column:business_id = 493
vii. Photo = id = 10000; business_id = 6943
viii. Tip = business_id = 3979; user_id = 537
ix. User = id = 10000
x. Friend = user_id = 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: "No"
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM user
		WHERE id IS NULL OR 
		  name IS NULL OR 
		  review_count IS NULL OR 
		  yelping_since IS NULL OR
		  useful IS NULL OR 
		  funny IS NULL OR 
		  cool IS NULL OR 
		  fans IS NULL OR 
		  average_stars IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_hot IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_more IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_profile IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_cute IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_list IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_note IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_plain IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_cool IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_funny IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_writer IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_photos IS NULL 
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

--SQL Command
SELECT MIN(column),MAX(column),AVG(column)
FROM table;
--
	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:1.0		max:5.0 	avg:3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:1		max:53		avg:1.9414

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

/*Choose Las Vegas as city and Restaurants as category*/
	+-----------+-------------+--------------+---------------------+--------------------+-----------------------+---------------+
| city      | category    | neighborhood | overall_star_rating | MIN(c.hours)       | MAX(c.hours)          | total_reviews |
+-----------+-------------+--------------+---------------------+--------------------+-----------------------+---------------+
| Las Vegas | Restaurants |              | 2-3 stars           | Friday|11:00-0:00  | Wednesday|11:00-0:00  |           861 |
| Las Vegas | Restaurants | Chinatown    | 4-5 stars           | Friday|10:00-23:00 | Wednesday|10:00-23:00 |          5376 |
| Las Vegas | Restaurants | Summerlin    | 4-5 stars           | Friday|11:00-20:00 | Wednesday|11:00-20:00 |          1176 |
+-----------+-------------+--------------+---------------------+--------------------+-----------------------+---------------+
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
The two groups have similar working hours. However based on the output above 2-3 stars have more working hours compared to 4-5 stars Restaurants.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes 4-5 stars group has more number of reviews compared to 2-3 stars group
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

No

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT a.city,
b.category,
a.neighborhood,
CASE 
WHEN stars >1 AND stars < 4 THEN '2-3 stars'
ELSE '4-5 stars' END overall_star_rating,
MIN(c.hours)
,MAX(c.hours)
,SUM(a.review_count) AS total_reviews
FROM business AS a
INNER JOIN category as b
ON a.id = b.business_id
INNER JOIN hours as c
ON a.id = c.business_id
WHERE city ='Las Vegas' AND category = 'Restaurants'
GROUP BY a.city,b.category,overall_star_rating,a.neighborhood


		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The reviews are more for the businesses which are open compared to the closed ones.

| is_open | COUNT(id) | SUM(review_count) |
+---------+-----------+-------------------+
|       0 |      1520 |             35261 |
|       1 |      8480 |            269300 |
+---------+-----------+-------------------+
         
         
ii. Difference 2: There are more categories in open businesses
+---------+-------------------+
| is_open | COUNT(b.category) |
+---------+-------------------+
|       0 |               122 |
|       1 |               574 |

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT a.is_open,COUNT(b.category)
FROM business a
INNER JOIN category b
ON a.id = b.business_id
GROUP BY is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Text Analytics

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I would like to perform text analytics on the customer reviews and see if there is any impact of reviews and their overall stars_rating.The description of the review is converted to lower case so that it is easier to find the word which we want. Also see what type of categories have a positive sentiment. Based on the words used in the text we can get a overview of the review. Something like if the review contains words like good, happy, love it is categorised as Positive review if it has sad, bad, worst in their review it is a negative review else it is "other".
                                   
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
