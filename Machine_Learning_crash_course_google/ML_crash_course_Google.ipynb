    "## Reducing Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a model, we need a good way to reduce the model’s loss. An iterative approach is one widely used method for reducing loss, and is as easy and efficient as walking down a hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing Loss: An Iterative Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous module introduced the concept of loss. Here, in this module, you'll learn how a machine learning model iteratively reduces loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative learning might remind you of the \"Hot and Cold\" kid's game for finding a hidden object like a thimble. In this game, the \"hidden object\" is the best possible model. You'll start with a wild guess (\"The value of w1 is 0.\") and wait for the system to tell you what the loss is. Then, you'll try another guess (\"The value of w1 is 0.5.\") and see what the loss is. Aah, you're getting warmer. Actually, if you play this game right, you'll usually be getting warmer. The real trick to the game is trying to find the best possible model as efficiently as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use this same iterative approach throughout the Machine Learning Crash Course, detailing various complications, particularly within that stormy cloud labeled \"Model (Prediction Function).\" Iterative strategies are prevalent in machine learning, primarily because they scale so well to large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"model\" takes one or more features as input and returns one prediction (y') as output. To simplify, consider a model that takes one feature and returns one prediction:\n",
    "                                \n",
    "                                y' = b+w1x1\n",
    "\n",
    "What initial values should we set for  and ? For linear regression problems, it turns out that the starting values aren't important. We could pick random values, but we'll just take the following trivial values instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "b = 0\n",
    "w1 = 0\n",
    "Suppose that the first feature value is 10. Plugging that feature value into the prediction function yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "                                y' = 0+0.10\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Compute Loss\" part of the diagram is the loss function that the model will use. Suppose we use the squared loss function. The loss function takes in two input values:\n",
    "                            Loss = (y-y')^2\n",
    "\n",
    "y': The model's prediction for features x\n",
    "\n",
    "y: The correct label corresponding to features x.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, we've reached the \"Compute parameter updates\" part of the diagram. It is here that the machine learning system examines the value of the loss function and generates new values for  and . For now, just assume that this mysterious box devises new values and then the machine learning system re-evaluates all those features against all those labels, yielding a new value for the loss function, which yields new parameter values. And the learning continues iterating until the algorithm discovers the model parameters with the lowest possible loss. Usually, you iterate until overall loss stops changing or at least changes extremely slowly. When that happens, we say that the model has converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "___A Machine Learning model is trained by starting with an initial guess for the weights and bias and iteratively adjusting those guesses until learning the weights and bias with the lowest possible loss.___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing Loss: Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative approach contained a green hand-wavy box entitled \"Compute parameter updates.\" We'll now replace that algorithmic fairy dust with something more substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we had the time and the computing resources to calculate the loss for all possible values of w1. For the kind of regression problems we've been examining, the resulting plot of loss vs.w1 will always be convex. In other words, the plot will always be bowl-shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convex problems have only one minimum; that is, only one place where the slope is exactly 0. That minimum is where the loss function converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the loss function for every conceivable value of  over the entire data set would be an inefficient way of finding the convergence point. Let's examine a better mechanism—very popular in machine learning—called __gradient descent.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage in gradient descent is to pick a starting value (a starting point) for w1. The starting point doesn't matter much; therefore, many algorithms simply set w1 to 0 or pick a random value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent algorithm then calculates the gradient of the loss curve at the starting point. The gradient of the loss is equal to the derivative (slope) of the curve, and tells you which way is \"warmer\" or \"colder.\" When there are multiple weights, the gradient is a vector of partial derivatives with respect to the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a gradient is a vector, so it has both of the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a direction\n",
    "- a magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient always points in the direction of steepest increase in the loss function. The gradient descent algorithm takes a step in the direction of the negative gradient in order to reduce loss as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent then repeats this process, edging ever closer to the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "___When performing gradient descent, we generalize the above process to tune all the model parameters simultaneously. For example, to find the optimal values of both w1 and the bias b , we calculate the gradients with respect to both w1 and b . Next, we modify the values of w1 and b based on their respective gradients. Then we repeat these steps until we reach minimum loss.___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing Loss: Learning Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, the gradient vector has both a direction and a magnitude. Gradient descent algorithms multiply the gradient by a scalar known as the __learning rate__ (also sometimes called step size) to determine the next point. For example, if the gradient magnitude is 2.5 and the learning rate is 0.01, then the gradient descent algorithm will pick the next point 0.025 away from the previous point.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hyperparameters__ are the knobs that programmers tweak in machine learning algorithms. Most machine learning programmers spend a fair amount of time tuning the learning rate. If you pick a learning rate that is too small, learning will take too long\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if you specify a learning rate that is too large, the next point will perpetually bounce haphazardly across the bottom of the well like a quantum mechanics experiment gone horribly wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a Goldilocks learning rate for every regression problem. The Goldilocks value is related to how flat the loss function is. If you know the gradient of the loss function is small then you can safely try a larger learning rate, which compensates for the small gradient and results in a larger step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing Loss: Optimizing Learning Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "___In practice, finding a \"perfect\" (or near-perfect) learning rate is not essential for successful model training. The goal is to find a learning rate large enough that gradient descent converges efficiently, but not so large that it never converges.___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing Loss: Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "In gradient descent, a __batch__ is the total number of examples you use to calculate the gradient in a single iteration. So far, we've assumed that the batch has been the entire data set. When working at Google scale, data sets often contain billions or even hundreds of billions of examples. Furthermore, Google data sets often contain huge numbers of features. Consequently, a batch can be enormous. A very large batch may cause even a single iteration to take a very long time to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large data set with randomly sampled examples probably contains redundant data. In fact, redundancy becomes more likely as the batch size grows. Some redundancy can be useful to smooth out noisy gradients, but enormous batches tend not to carry much more predictive value than large batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we could get the right gradient on average for much less computation? By choosing examples at random from our data set, we could estimate (albeit, noisily) a big average from a much smaller one. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) takes this idea to the extreme--it uses only a single example (a batch size of 1) per iteration. Given enough iterations, SGD works but is very noisy. The term \"stochastic\" indicates that the one example comprising each batch is chosen at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent__ (mini-batch SGD) is a compromise between full-batch iteration and SGD. A mini-batch is typically between 10 and 1,000 examples, chosen at random. Mini-batch SGD reduces the amount of noise in SGD but is still more efficient than full-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the explanation, we focused on gradient descent for a single feature. Rest assured that gradient descent also works on feature sets that contain multiple features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing Loss: Check Your Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "01. When performing gradient descent on a large data set, which of the following batch sizes will likely be more efficient?\n",
    "    - A small batch or even a batch of one example (SGD).\n",
    "     Amazingly enough, performing gradient descent on a small batch or even a batch of one example is usually more efficient than the full batch. After all, finding the gradient of one example is far cheaper than finding the gradient of millions of examples. To ensure a good representative sample, the algorithm scoops up another random small batch (or batch of one) on every iteration."

    "1. We looked at a process of using a test set and a training set to drive iterations of model development. On each iteration, we'd train on the training data and evaluate on the test data, using the evaluation results on test data to guide choices of and changes to various model hyperparameters like learning rate and features. Is there anything wrong with this approach? (Pick only one answer.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans. Doing many rounds of this procedure might cause us to implicitly fit to the peculiarities of our specific test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation Set\n",
    "Partitioning a data set into a training set and test set lets you judge whether a given model will generalize well to new data. However, using only two partitions may be insufficient when doing many rounds of hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation Set: Another Partition\n",
    "The previous module introduced partitioning a data set into a training set and a test set. This partitioning enabled you to train on one set of examples and then to test the model against a different set of examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Tweak model\" means adjusting anything about the model you can dream up—from changing the learning rate, to adding or removing features, to designing a completely new model from scratch. At the end of this workflow, you pick the model that does best on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing the data set into two sets is a good idea, but not a panacea. You can greatly reduce your chances of overfitting by partitioning the data set into the three subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the __validation set__ to evaluate results from the training set. Then, use the test set to double-check your evaluation after the model has \"passed\" the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this improved workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick the model that does best on the validation set.\n",
    "2. Double-check that model against the test set.\n",
    "This is a better workflow because it creates fewer exposures to the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Test sets and validation sets \"wear out\" with repeated use. That is, the more you use the same data to make decisions about hyperparameter settings or other model improvements, the less confidence you'll have that these results actually generalize to new, unseen data._\n",
    "\n",
    "_If possible, it's a good idea to collect more data to \"refresh\" the test set and validation set. Starting anew is a great reset._"

    "A machine learning model can't directly see, hear, or sense input examples. Instead, you must create a representation of the data to provide the model with a useful vantage point into the data's key qualities. That is, in order to train a model, you must choose the set of features that best represent the data."
